## Structure
- `data/` - sample CSV datasets: `sales_data.csv`, `competitors.csv`, `promotions.csv`
- `notebooks/retail_analysis.ipynb` - walkthrough notebook for analysis
- `scripts/` - reusable Python scripts for cleaning and analysis
- `dashboards/` - Power BI placeholder and exported figures
- `reports/` - PDF summary report with key findings

## How to run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib jupyter`
